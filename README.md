# Titanic

The **Titanic+Tutorial - OL.ipynb** file was just me playing around with the sample dataset on Kaggle. Not finished with it yet. For the most part, I included a mixture of some of [Deependra Singh Jhala's work](https://www.kaggle.com/dsjhala/titanic-starting-with-kaggle-81-6-random-forest) that he posted in a kernel, using Python to impute data and implement the Random Forest Tree algorithm.
