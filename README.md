# Titanic

The **Titanic+Tutorial - OL.ipynb** file was just me playing around with the sample dataset on Kaggle. Not finished with it yet. For the most part, I followed [hamelg's blog](http://hamelg.blogspot.com/2015/12/python-for-data-analysis-part-30-random.html) as a preliminary exploration of the data. 

**Titanic Tutorial Pt II** included a mixture of [Deependra Singh Jhala's work](https://www.kaggle.com/dsjhala/titanic-starting-with-kaggle-81-6-random-forest) that he posted in a kernel, using Python to impute data and implement the Random Forest Tree algorithm. Still not finished. I'd like to use my trained RF algorithm to predict the test set next.
